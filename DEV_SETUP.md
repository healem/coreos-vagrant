# Setup the development environment for curator

## Install coreos-vagrant

Follow the direction here: https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant

This will have you install VirtualBox and Vagrant

Note that VirtualBox requires the system it is running on to support VT-x.  If this is a VM, then nested virtualization must be enabled.
